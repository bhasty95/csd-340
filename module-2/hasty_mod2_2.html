        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

        <p class="intro">My name is Brandon Hasty and I currently live in Florida. I was born    and raised in California, but during covid I decided to move to the south. I like to surf,   play video games and race rc cars competively.</p>

        <p>Even though the water is pretty flat in florida, you can still surf at times. It defintely does not compare to the waves on the west coast, but the crystal clear water makes up for it. <span class ="sentence">One nice thing about the beaches in FLorida is the fishing.</span> You can catch some real nice fish from the beach and the piers without needing a boat.</p>

        <p>One day my dad and I decided to buy rc cars and take the to a local track that hosts races every other weekend. The hobby ended up growing with the purchase of more cars and tools. I know am sponsored by a couple teams and travel around the south and east attending races.</p>

        <p>I currently live my mom, dad and my sister and her family. The rest of my family still lives in California. We try to visit them as much as possible, but it is hard not being able to spend much time with them anymore. </p>
